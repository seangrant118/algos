--- Classes --- 

[ABC] --- character set --- Match any character in the set
[^ABC] --- negated set --- Match any character not in the set
[A-Z] --- range --- Matches a character having a character code between the two specificed characters, inclusive
. --- dot --- matches any character except line breaks. Equivalent to [^\n\r]
[\s\S] --- match any --- A character set that can be used to match any character, including line breaks, without the dotall flags, [^] is an alternative (not supported on all browsers)
\w --- word --- Matches any word character (alphanumeric & underscore). Only matches low-ascii characters (no accented or non roman characters, Equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_])
\W --- not word --- Matches any character that is not a word character
\d --- digit --- Matches any digit character
\D --- not digit -- Matches any non digit
\s --- whitespace --- matches any white space characters (spaces, tabs, linebreaks)
\S --- not whitespace --- matches any non whitespace characters

--- Anchors ---

^ --- beginning --- Matches the beginning of the string, or the beginning of a line if the multiline flag is enbled. This matches a position, not a characters.
$ --- end --- Matches the end of the string, or the end of a line if the multiline flag is enbled. This matches a position, not a characters.
\b --- word boundary --- Matches a word boundary position between a word character and non-word character or position.
\B --- not word boundary --- Matches any position that is not a word boundary. This matches a position not a character.

--- Quantifiers & Alternation ---

+ --- plus --- Matches one or more of the preceding token
* --- star --- Matches zero or more of the preceding token
{1,3} --- Quantifier - Matches the specificed quantity of the preious token. {1,3} will match 1 to 3. {3} will match exactly 3. {3,} will match 3 or more
? --- optional --- Matches 0 or 1 of the preceding token, effectively making it option (colou?r)
? --- lazy --- Makes the rpeceding quanitifier lazy, causing it to match as few characters as possible. By default, quanitifiers are greedy, and will match as many characters as possible (ex: b\w+?)
| --- alternation --- acts like a boolean OR. Matches the expression before or after the |. It can operate within a group, or a whole expression. The patterns will be tested in order.
